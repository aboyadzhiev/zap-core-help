<h1>主动扫描选项屏幕</h1>
<p>
此屏幕允许您配置 <a href="../../../start/features/ascan.html">主动扫描</a> 选项：

<h3>Number of Hosts Scanned Concurrently</h3>
同时扫描的主机的最大数量。
增加这个值可能会给运行ZAP的计算机带来额外的压力。

<h3>Concurrent Scanning Threads per Host</h3>
扫描器将在每个主机上使用的线程数。<br>
增加线程数将加快扫描速度, 但可能会在运行ZAP的计算机和目标主机上增加额外的压力。

<h3>Max Results to List</h3>
将显示在主动扫描选项卡中的结果数量。<br>
显示大量结果会显著增加扫描所需的时间。

<h3>Maximum Rule Duration (minutes; 0 is unlimited)</h3>
任何单个规则可以运行的最长时间（几分钟）。 零意味着没有限制。 这可以用来防止需要花费过多时间的规则。 

<h3>Max alerts any rule can raise</h3>
The maximum number of alerts any rule can raise during the active scan, scan rules that reach this value are skipped.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The maximum might be exceed due to threading.

<h3>Maximum Scan Duration (minutes; 0 is unlimited)</h3>
The maximum time that the whole scan can run for in minutes. Zero means no limit. This can be used to ensure that a scan is completed around a set time. 

<h3>Delay When Scanning (In Milliseconds)</h3>
The delay in milliseconds between each request.<br>
Setting this to a non zero value will increase the time an active scan takes, but will put less of a strain
on the target host.
<br><strong>Note:</strong> This option has been deprecated and it will be removed in a future release. Use the Network &gt; Rate Limit option instead. The latter option
allows to enforce the rate at which the requests are sent while the Delay When Scanning doesn't.

<h3>Inject plugin ID in header for all active scan requests.</h3>
If this option is selected the active scanner will inject the request header <code>X-ZAP-Scan-ID</code> with the ID of
the scan rule that's sending the HTTP requests.

<h3>Handle anti-CSRF tokens.</h3>
If this option is selected then the active scanner will attempt to automatically request 
<a href="../../../start/features/anticsrf.html">反CSRF</a> tokens when required.<br>
Previously this would have forced the scanner to only use one thread, but that is no longer the case.
You are strongly recommended to check that the anti CSRF tokens are being correctly generated if more than one thread is being used,
for example using custom <a href="../../../start/features/tags.html">tags</a> to check for success / failure patterns in the response.

<h3>In Attack Mode prompt to rescan nodes when scope changed.</h3>
If this option is selected then when you select Attack <a href="../../../start/features/modes.html">模式时</a> you will be prompted to choose whether to rescan nodes in scope.<br>
If the option is not selected then the following option will control whether the nodes are rescanned.

<h3>In Attack Mode always rescan nodes when scope changed.</h3>
If this option is selected then when running in Attack <a href="../../../start/features/modes.html">mode</a> all nodes in scope will be rescanned if the scope changes.<br>
This is not recommended for large sites as it could take a long time.

<h3>Default Active Scan Policy</h3>
The <a href="../../../start/features/scanpolicy.html">Scan Policy</a> that is used by default when you start an active scan.

<h3>Attack Mode Scan Policy</h3>
The <a href="../../../start/features/scanpolicy.html">Scan Policy</a> that is used for scanning in 
Attack <a href="../../../start/features/modes.html">mode</a>.

<h3>Max Progress Chart in Mins</h3>
The maximum time in minutes for which response codes will be charted in the
<a href="../scanprogress.html">Scan Progress dialog</a>.<br>
To disable the chart the option should be set to zero minutes.
