<h1>Modes</h1>
<p>
ZAP has a 'mode' which can be:
<ul>
<li>Safe - no potentially dangerous operations permitted.</li>
<li>Protected - you can only perform (potentially) dangerous actions on URLs in the <a href="scope.html">scope</a>.</li>
<li>Standard - does not restrict anything.</li>
<li>ATTACK - new nodes that are in <a href="scope.html">scope</a> are <a href="ascan.html">actively scanned</a> as soon as they are discovered.</li>
</ul>
It is recommended that you use the Protected mode to ensure that you only attack sites that you mean to.<br/><br/>

The mode can be changed via the <a href="../../ui/tltoolbar.html">toolbar</a>
(or the ZAP API) and is persisted between sessions.<br/><br/>

Examples of the things that will not be possible in either Safe mode or in Protected mode when not acting on URLs in the Scope:

<ul>
<li>Spidering</li>
<li>Active Scanning</li>
<li>Fuzzing</li>
<li>Force Browsing</li>
<li>Breaking (intercepting)</li>
<li>Resending requests</li>
</ul>

You can define the <a href="scanpolicy.html">Scan Policy</a> to be used for the Attack mode the <a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/ascan.html">Options Active Scan screen</a>.<br>
